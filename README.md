# Solar Modular Synth
 A modular synth based around Arduino
First and foremost - a big shoutout to the creative team over at [Bleep Labs](https://bleeplabs.com/) for the original build which is called the Neblophone.

I wanted to be able to add some playability to the little modular synth that I'm putting together and after a extensive search on Google I stumbled on the Neblophone which I have re-named 'Solar' for this build.

The main changes that I have implemented are; I changed the stylus style keyboard over to actual momentary switches, I designed a front panel and custom PCB which can be used in Eurorack modules (or as a fun standalone synth) and lastly, added 2 sync inputs so you can connect it to other synths.

The sync inputs can be a little fiddily but once tuned in work great.  However, you don;t have to sync in the synth as you can just play it over the top of whatever you are jamming to.

So what are the features of the little synth?

– Eight waveforms

– Light controlled (Vactrol) analog low-pass filter with five adjustable LFO LED modes.

– Perfect tuning across six octaves.

– Adjustable temperament and key.

– Six arpeggio modes with adjustable rate.

The main goal with building this module is to create my own 'simple to build' modular synth. I wanted to keep everything as easy as possble with each module built with the following aims:

-   Can be powered by 9V (and 12V)

-   Easy to build with minimum components

-   Use Arduino to keep it simple (plus it helps to keep the components down and everything in tune)

-   Can fit into any modular synth Eurorck (include the ability to power the module via normal module power sources)

-   Has to sound great!

It's the first time that I have utilized cherry MX switches and I'm so glad that I used them! 
Lastly, as I have mentioned above, Solar makes a fun standalone synth and has been designed to be able to fit in Eurorack modules and powered via a Eurorack power supply!

I have also completed a step by step guide which you can find on Instructables
